# About
I've created a stopwatch web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML structures the elements, while JavaScript implements functions for starting, pausing, and resetting the stopwatch, along with tracking and displaying lap times. Users can accurately measure and record time intervals with this interactive and user-friendly application. Check it out!
